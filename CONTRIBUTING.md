## Raising issues

Please raise any bug reports on the relevant project's issue tracker.

A good bug report is one that make it easy for us to understand what you were

 - What is your platform? (Linux, macOS, ...)
 - What does `DEBUG=node_red_contrib_opcua_iiot node -v` say? (log files are welcome)

of existing code, it may well get rejected if you haven't discussed it on the relevant project's issue tracker first.
